      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a fourth-year Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at
        Memorial University of Newfoundland, with a strong enthusiasm for data
        science and web development. I am actively seeking a work term where I
        can leverage my skills, learn from industry experts, and grow both
        personally and professionally. Passionate about connecting with
        like-minded individuals, I enjoy discussing technology, tackling
        societal challenges, and having fun along the way. Outside of academics,
        soccer is my ultimate passionâ€”playing, watching, and immersing myself in
        everything about the sport. Looking ahead, I aspire to give back to my
        community by using my knowledge and influence to ensure that youth have
        access to better education and support in pursuing their dreams. Growing
        up, I often felt the lack of consistent guidance towards a specific
        goal, and I am driven to be the change I wish to see. By empowering the
        next generation, I hope to create a positive, lasting impact in my
        community.
